Memo: Explanation of Technical Difficulties

Due to a malware issue, my laptop's CPU was maxed out, causing frequent freezing and preventing me from recording, processing, and uploading files. I have identified and resolved the issue today.

Additionally, there was a change in the UOL enquiry portal, which I was unable to access. Prior to the deadline, I sent an email to UOL regarding my technical difficulties but received an automated response informing me that the email address had been discontinued.

I respectfully ask that these circumstances be taken into consideration during the review of my submission.

Thank you for your understanding.
